### Hi there, I'm Angel! 👋
I'm a Statistics MSc student at ETH Zurich 🎓 and a Data Science Intern at Roche 💼, passionate about AI and ML 🤖. I'm particularly interested in applying these techniques to big-impact real-world problems. 

I'm an easy-going person who loves sports 🏃‍♂️ and reading 📚. Book recommendations are very welcome!

## About Me 🙋‍♂️
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've focused on deepening my knowledge in AI, ML, and Data Science. Why? Because I believe that these areas have an unique potential to change the world for the better🌱.

## Professional and academic training 🚀
# Work Experience 💼
- **Data Science Intern at Roche**: 
Developed descriptive and predictive models in healthcare using R and Python. Worked on data visualization, data wrangling, and machine learning model implementation. 
My past projects include developing a machine learning model for disease positivity prediction, working with highly unbalanced datasets, and improving model interpretability and transferability. 
I have been utilizing Utilized various of the classic R packages and Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, xgboost, and randomForest; scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk...

- What was I before an official "Data Scientist"?
I gathered experience in multiple roles that contributed to my growth in the data field. As a **Management Consultant** in a boutique firm in Spain, I honed my soft skills and worked extensively with business data, which inspired me to pursue Data Science. Later, as a **R&D Project Engineer** in a spin-off company, I developed quantitative algorithms for medical device optimization, focusing on data-driven solutions. This experience sparked my passion for entrepreneurship and led me to publish my [first first-author paper](https://opg.optica.org/ao/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ao-61-27-8091), adapting genetic algorithms to signal processing.

# Academic Training 🎓
- Master's in Statistics: I have been focusing on the statistical foundations of machine learning and AI. Took courses like Time Series Analysis, Advanced Statistical Modelling, Fundamentals of Machine Learning, and Computational Statistics.

- Bachelor's in Engineering (Major in Biomedical Engineering): Applied engineering thinking and quantitative methods to solve high-impact real-world problems in healthcare.
