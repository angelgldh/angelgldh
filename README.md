# Hi there, I'm Angel! 👋
I'm a Statistics MSc student at ETH Zurich 🎓 and a Data Science Intern at Roche 💼, passionate about AI and ML 🤖. I'm particularly interested in applying these techniques to big-impact real-world problems. 

I'm an easy-going person who loves sports 🏃‍♂️ and reading 📚. Book recommendations are very welcome!

## About Me 🙋‍♂️
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've focused on deepening my knowledge in AI, ML, and Data Science. Why? Because I believe that these areas have an unique potential to change the world for the better🌱.

## Professional and academic training 🚀
### Work Experience 💼
- **Data Science Intern at Roche**: 
Developed descriptive and predictive models in healthcare using R and Python. Worked on data visualization, data wrangling, and machine learning model implementation. 
My past projects include developing a machine learning model for disease positivity prediction, working with highly unbalanced datasets, and improving model interpretability and transferability. 
I have been utilizing Utilized various of the classic R packages and Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, xgboost, and randomForest; scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk...

- What was I before an official "Data Scientist"?
I gathered experience in multiple roles that contributed to my growth in the data field. As a **Management Consultant** in a boutique firm in Spain, I honed my soft skills and worked extensively with business data, which inspired me to pursue Data Science. Later, as a **R&D Project Engineer** in a spin-off company, I developed quantitative algorithms for medical device optimization, focusing on data-driven solutions. This experience sparked my passion for entrepreneurship and led me to publish my [first first-author paper](https://opg.optica.org/ao/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ao-61-27-8091), adapting genetic algorithms to signal processing.

### Academic Training 🎓
- Master's in **Statistics**: I decided to pursue my Master's in Statistics to gain a deeper understanding of the statistical foundations of machine learning and AI. My goal? To understand the inner workings of ML and AI algorithms. I wanted to go from merely running algorithms to understanding the inner mechanisms of machine learning model development and optimization. I´ve taken courses like Time Series Analysis, Advanced Statistical Modelling, Fundamentals of Machine Learning, and Computational Statistics.

- Bachelor's in **Engineering** (Major in Biomedical Engineering): I chose Biomedical Engineering because I always wanted to apply engineering thinking and quantitative methods to high-impact real-world problems. And what is more "high-impact-and-real-world" than healthcare? However, as I progressed in my career, I realized that the Data Science field was the best driver to achieve this goal, rather than focusing solely on bioengineering.


### Random achievements I am proud of 🌟

International Chemistry Academic Olympiad medalist 🥇

Medalist in both Chemistry and Physics Olympiads 🏅

Worked as a pro-bono consulting project manager 🌍

Not-yet-confirmed entrepreneur 💡

Marathon finisher 🏃‍


## Areas of Interest 🎯
### Main Expertise: ML and Stats 🏆
- Machine Learning: I'm passionate about working with tabular data and ensemble methods (who doesn't like a random forest 🌲). I have learned, I am still learning and I will always focus on the ability to create robust and interpretable models that solve real-world problems.

- Statistical Methods: I always have an eye at the stats behing any method I train. Having experience in statistical modeling I always try to look for the underlying assumptions and limitations of various ML algorithms. 

### Areas of Further Development and Interest 🚀
The data science space is just huge, and I am excited about improving my knowledge in all of the following fields.

- MLOps: I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in MLOps to streamline the process of deploying, monitoring, and managing ML models more efficiently 🔄.

- Deep Learning: I am excited to deepen my knowledge in this area to tackle increasingly complex and challenging problems 🧠.

- Recommendation Systems: I am very keen to develop personalized and engaging user experiences through recommendation algorithms 🎯 [Expect updates soon ...]

- Computer Vision: I am excited to unlock new insights and applications by teaching machines to "see" and understand images and videos 📷.

## My GitHub Projects 💻
I am happy to keep growing my GitHub! These are the main repositories github.com/angelgldh has at the moment:

- School Work: A collection of projects from my university courses, covering topics like introductory ML methods, Bayesian approaches, and reinforcement learning.
- HackerRank: I regularly participate in HackerRank challenges. Most of the problems are part of the *AI > Statistics and Machine Learning* category 🧩.
- Recommendation System (WIP): Working on a project to develop a recommendation system for personalized user experiences.
- Sign Recognition Kaggle (WIP): Developing a computer vision model for sign recognition as part of a Kaggle competition 🚦.
